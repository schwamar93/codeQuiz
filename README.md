# codeQuiz
For this assignment I created a javascript coding quiz that tracks right and wrong answers, time it takes to complete the quiz, and final scores of those who complete it. 

USER STORY
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
